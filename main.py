They are also made of plastics and polymers, so they should be disposed of with the proper care. However, moving to making your own clothes for yourself or friends is far better than participating in fast fashion, as well as being."},

Take the proper care to recycling plastic parts. The overall environmental impact is poor due to the large amount of plastic involved."},

Look to sharpen these before seeking a replacement, and when disposing keep note of local metal and sharp handling policies. The making of these use a large amount of energy and water, so it is in the best interest of the environment to keep them functioning through repair and sharpening rather than to replace them. Make sure to only use this on fabric for best longevity â€“ use on paper can cause bluntness."},

This has a low environmental impact, however mass production of paper can cause issues with deforestation, so when disposing of this item make sure to recycle appropriately. Making your own clothes can also be beneficial for the environment, as we move into a period where fast fashion is more criticised for its negative environmental impact. "}
